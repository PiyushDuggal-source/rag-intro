# RAG-Intro: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with ChromaDB and Ollama

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using ChromaDB for document storage and retrieval, and Ollama for embedding generation and question-answering tasks. The pipeline processes documents, generates embeddings, stores them in a vector database, and retrieves relevant information to answer user queries.
